Gail's Hello World Repository
I'm a new coder; not fully trained and not certified (yet), but I'm getting there.
If you'd asked me 20 years ago if I thought I'd be learning HTML, CSS, and PHP in my 50s, I would have laughed. 
Now, however, I've discovered a whole new world that I get to build myself. Does it get better than that?
